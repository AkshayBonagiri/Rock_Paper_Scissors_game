# 🪨 Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple command-line **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game written in Python where you play against the computer.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. Type your choice: `Rock`, `Paper`, or `Scissor`.
3. The computer randomly picks a move.
4. The game declares whether you win, lose, or draw based on the standard rules:
   - Rock beats Scissor
   - Paper beats Rock
   - Scissor beats Paper

## 🧠 Example

```bash
Choose: rock
You choose Rock and the computer choose Scissor
You Won!
```

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries needed — uses only Python’s built-in `random` module.

## 🚀 Run the Game

```bash
python rock_paper_scissors.py
```
